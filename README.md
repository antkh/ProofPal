# ProofPal

This repository includes all the codes used in our project ProofPal.

ProoPal.py contains the main code which is the reinforcement learning algorithm. It takes as input a pre-processed theorem (as described in our paper). It outputs either a proof (in readable CNF form), or indication that no proof was found (i.e. maximum iterations is exceeded).

GenerateSample.py is used to generate the synthetic data, which is used in evaluating the accuracy of our model. We generate synthetic data as described in our paper.

Accuracy.py evaluates the data generated by the previous file using our reinforcement learning algorithm. We indicate for each datum whether it is True (proof was found) or False (maximum iterations was exceeded without finding a proof).
